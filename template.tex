\section{Other information}

Renewable energies are an important breakpoint in my professional career, showing me how every single aspect in mankind is connected, including the software we use. The fact of being a Linux user, brings an experience inside the know-how of how software is structured developed, designed and focused on a particular group with a specific need, inclusive it helps to lose doubts about how much you can customize the user experience in all the possible ways, coupled with previous experiences developing using python during my professional career to improve economical and physical calculations, discovering how helpful is know programming.

%\section{Other information}

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
